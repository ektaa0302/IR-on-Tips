# 🌍 IR on Tips – International Relations Prompt Tool

**IR on Tips** is a project built to simulate and simplify **International Relations (IR)** research through an interactive tool. It allows users to explore the bilateral and multilateral dynamics between countries — from history to current and future relations.

## 🛠️ Features

- Select **Country A** and optionally **Country B**
- Choose the **domain** of interest:
  - Defence
  - Trade & Economy
  - Culture & History
  - Health & Education
  - Science & Space
  - Strategic & Tech Collaboration
- View structured summaries of each country or comparison between the two
- Built for students, diplomats, UPSC/IR aspirants & researchers

## 📌 Current Version (Pre-fed)

This is a **pre-fed prototype** built using Notion and basic interface components. All data has been curated manually based on reliable global sources.  
⚠️ **Note:** It does not yet use live or AI-generated data.

## 🤖 Future Scope (AI-Integrated)

The upcoming version will:
- Be backed by **ChatGPT** to fetch **real-time**, **current-affairs-based** content
- Enable **AI-generated diplomatic analysis**
- Allow **user bookmarks**, **offline search**, and more

## 💼 Why this project?

I designed this as part of my **Prompt Engineering portfolio** to:
- Demonstrate use of role-based prompts for real-world analysis
- Bridge current affairs and AI tooling
- Build impactful tools for global users

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Choose a country (or two countries for comparison)
2. Select the area of international relations you’re interested in
3. View the structured output from pre-fed data
4. (Future versions will auto-fetch AI-generated content)
